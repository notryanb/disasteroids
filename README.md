# Disasteroids

First shot at game development in Rust. 
Using [rocket] as a model for learning game design and the piston group of libraries.

## Goals
- Full "vector" style 2d game that has a similar feel to asteroids
- Multiplayer (web sockets => tokio libs?)
- Game states with menu
- Custom sound effects (generated or samples?)
